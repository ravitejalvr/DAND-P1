# Data Analyst Nano Degree Project-1:

This project objective statement is to explore a dataset of choice.

I selected Titanic Dataset and the results were given in this file. The pics are part of the html and ipython notebook in this repository.

It is observed that 342 people out of 891 people survived. Various analysis for identifying survival is done.
Firstly, the data is imported and seen for missing values. It is observed that Age and Cabin are having maximum missing values.
Cabin is ignored from future analysis as it is having major data missing.

## Questions asked:
1. What are chances of survival if Age > 40
2. What are chances of survival if Embarked = Q
3. What are chances of survival if Fare > 70.

## Answers: 
1.30.67%

2.63.82%

3.72.3%

It can be understood that people who are young and people who paid large were rescued first. 
Also, people who embarked from Q were rescued. 

Also, further analysis with various plots and percentage wise division of bins is done in IPython Notebook.

It is observed that with increase in fare, survival rate increase, increase in age decreased survival rate & finally
people from class 1 & 2 have more than twice survival rate than people from class 3.

These are some of my observations from Titanic Data-Set. For plots, please visit IPython Notebook.
